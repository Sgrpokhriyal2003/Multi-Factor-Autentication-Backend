# üîê Multi Factor Authentication REST API


---

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Users can register with email, password, and optional 2FA setup.
- ‚úÖ Password is hashed securely using bcryptjs before saving to MongoDB.
- ‚úÖ Users can log in using email and password.
- ‚úÖ Credentials are validated using bcryptjs.
- ‚úÖ If the user has 1FA enabled, login proceeds to MFA step

## 2FA Setup with Speakeasy
---
  - On account settings, users can enable 2FA.
  - Speakeasy generates a unique secret key for the user.
  - A QR code or secret key is shared to be scanned in an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator).
  - The user must verify the 2FA code once to activate 2FA.
---

##  2FA Verification 
---
  - After successful password login, if 2FA is enabled:
  - API expects a time-based one-time password (TOTP).
  - Uses speakeasy to verify the provided 6-digit TOTP against the stored secret.  
  - On success, issues a signed JWT token.
  - On failure, access is denied.
---

## JWT Token Issuance
---
  - On successful login + 2FA (if applicable), a JWT is signed and returned.
  - JWT contains user ID, email, and 2FA status.
  - Token expiration (e.g., 1h) can be configured.
